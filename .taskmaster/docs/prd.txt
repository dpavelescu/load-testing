# Overview  
This project aims to develop a comprehensive Kubernetes pod resource sizing solution that accurately determines optimal CPU and memory allocations based on empirical load testing data. The system addresses the critical challenge of right-sizing pod resources to balance performance, cost efficiency, and system reliability while maintaining elasticity for varying load patterns.

The solution targets DevOps engineers, platform teams, and application architects who need data-driven insights for Kubernetes resource planning. It provides automated resource recommendations through load simulation, eliminating guesswork and reducing both over-provisioning costs and under-provisioning risks.

# Core Features  
## Load Testing Framework
- K6-based load generation with configurable patterns (steady, spike, ramp-up/down)
- Parameterized load scenarios supporting different request volumes and concurrency levels
- Configurable data payload sizes per request for memory impact simulation
- Database latency simulation with adjustable response times

## Resource Monitoring & Analysis
- Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) integration for baseline resource recommendations
- Real-time resource consumption tracking during load tests
- Correlation analysis between load patterns and resource utilization
- Prometheus metrics collection with Grafana visualization dashboards

## Horizontal Scaling Calculations
- Single-instance resource profiling with extrapolation to multi-instance scenarios
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configuration recommendations
- Load distribution analysis across multiple pod instances
- Elasticity modeling for dynamic scaling scenarios

## Spring Boot Test Service
- Configurable employee data simulation with variable attributes
- Adjustable string field sizes for memory consumption testing
- REST API endpoints for different data retrieval patterns
- Database interaction simulation with configurable latency

# Logical Dependency Chain
## Foundation First (Phase 1)
- Spring Boot service must be built before load testing can begin
- Kubernetes deployment configuration required for service hosting
- Basic K6 scripts needed to establish load testing capabilities
- Resource monitoring foundation using native Kubernetes tools

## Monitoring Infrastructure (Phase 2)
- Prometheus installation and configuration depends on Kubernetes foundation
- VPA setup requires operational Spring Boot service for baseline profiling
- Grafana dashboards require Prometheus data collection to be functional
- K6-Prometheus integration builds upon basic load testing framework

## Advanced Analytics (Phase 3)
- Spike testing scenarios require stable monitoring infrastructure
- Horizontal scaling analysis depends on single-instance profiling completion
- Advanced dashboards require comprehensive metrics collection from Phase 2
- Correlation analysis needs historical data from multiple test runs

## Production Integration (Phase 4)
- Configuration management requires proven load testing scenarios
- Database simulation builds upon established service architecture
- Validation workflows require complete monitoring and analysis capabilities
- Documentation synthesis requires all technical components to be operational

# Risks and Mitigations
