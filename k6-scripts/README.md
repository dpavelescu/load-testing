K6_OUT_DIR=./k6-results

## Test Scripts

1. **health-check-test.js** - Quick smoke test (30 seconds)
   - Tests all critical endpoints
   - Low load, fast response requirements
   - Good for CI/CD pipelines

2. **basic-load-test.js** - Standard load test (4 minutes)
   - Gradual ramp-up with different employee data scenarios
   - Tests response times and error rates
   - Simulates realistic user behavior

3. **memory-simulation-test.js** - Memory-focused test (8 minutes)
   - Tests memory scenarios and cache operations
   - Longer duration for memory pressure testing
   - Includes garbage collection and memory statistics

### **‚ö° Throughput-Based CPU Calibration** - `throughput-cpu-calibration.js` ‚≠ê
**Purpose**: Precise throughput control for CPU resource calibration
- **Exact RPS Control**: Maintains precisely 3 RPS (configurable)  
- **CPU Focused**: Sustained load for accurate CPU measurement
- **VPA Integration**: Perfect for CPU request/limit optimization
- **Production Ready**: Configurable for any throughput requirement

**Key Features**:
- Uses `constant-arrival-rate` executor for exact throughput
- No dependency on virtual user calculations
- Weighted request scenarios (light/moderate CPU operations)
- Comprehensive CPU calibration metrics

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- Install k6: https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/
- Ensure the Spring Boot service is running

### Commands

```bash
# Quick health check
k6 run k6-scripts/health-check-test.js

# Basic load test
k6 run k6-scripts/basic-load-test.js

# Memory simulation test
k6 run k6-scripts/memory-simulation-test.js

# Throughput-based CPU calibration test
k6 run k6-scripts/throughput-cpu-calibration.js

# With custom base URL
k6 run -e BASE_URL=http://my-service:8080 k6-scripts/basic-load-test.js

# Save results to file
k6 run --out json=results.json k6-scripts/basic-load-test.js

# Run with summary output
k6 run --summary-export=summary.json k6-scripts/basic-load-test.js
```

## Expected Performance Baselines

### Health Check Test
- Response time: p(95) < 200ms
- Error rate: < 1%

### Basic Load Test
- Response time: p(95) < 500ms
- Error rate: < 10%
- Throughput: > 50 requests/second

### Memory Simulation Test
- Response time: p(95) < 2000ms (memory operations are slower)
- Error rate: < 15%
- Memory usage should be observable in metrics

## Monitoring During Tests

1. **Actuator Endpoints:**
   - `/actuator/health` - Overall service health
   - `/actuator/metrics` - JVM and application metrics
   - `/actuator/prometheus` - Prometheus-formatted metrics

2. **Memory Endpoints:**
   - `/api/memory/stats` - Current JVM memory usage
   - `/api/memory/cache/info` - Cache statistics

3. **Docker Stats:**
   ```bash
   docker stats resource-sizing-service
   ```

## Interpreting Results

- **http_req_duration**: Request response time
- **http_req_failed**: Percentage of failed requests
- **http_reqs**: Total number of requests
- **vus**: Current number of virtual users
- **iterations**: Total test iterations completed

## üéØ Virtual Users vs Throughput: The Critical Difference

### **The Problem with Virtual Users**
Traditional load testing uses "virtual users" (VUs), but this creates unpredictable throughput:
- **VUs ‚â† Requests per Second**: 10 VUs might generate 5 RPS or 50 RPS depending on response times
- **Variable CPU Load**: CPU usage fluctuates based on response times, not request rate
- **Inconsistent VPA Data**: VPA gets inconsistent CPU patterns, making recommendations unreliable

### **The Solution: Throughput-Based Testing**
Our throughput-based approach uses K6's `constant-arrival-rate` executor:
- **Exact RPS Control**: Maintains precisely 3 RPS regardless of response times
- **Consistent CPU Load**: Predictable CPU utilization for accurate VPA calibration
- **Real-World Simulation**: Mirrors actual production traffic patterns

### **Mathematical Relationship**
```
Traditional Formula (Unreliable):
VUs = Target RPS √ó Average Response Time

Better Formula (K6 Arrival Rate):
arrival_rate = exact_requests_per_second
VUs = automatically_calculated_by_k6
```

### **CPU Calibration Usage**

#### Basic Usage (3 RPS for 10 minutes):
```bash
k6 run k6-scripts/throughput-cpu-calibration.js
```

#### Custom Throughput:
```bash
k6 run -e TARGET_RPS=5 -e TEST_DURATION=15m k6-scripts/throughput-cpu-calibration.js
```

#### Different CPU Calibration Scenarios:
```bash
# Light CPU calibration (1 RPS)
k6 run -e TARGET_RPS=1 -e TEST_DURATION=15m k6-scripts/throughput-cpu-calibration.js

# Moderate CPU calibration (5 RPS)  
k6 run -e TARGET_RPS=5 -e TEST_DURATION=8m k6-scripts/throughput-cpu-calibration.js

# Heavy CPU calibration (10 RPS)
k6 run -e TARGET_RPS=10 -e TEST_DURATION=5m k6-scripts/throughput-cpu-calibration.js
```

#### Windows Batch File:
```batch
run-throughput-test.bat
```
